# Terminal-Based RPG

That's my experimental terminal-based RPG! This project is a **work-in-progress** and is being actively developed and updated.

## Overview

This RPG should feature:
- A character system (Inventory, Status, etc.) 
- Multiple rooms with unique attributes for you to choose in order to progress
- Room modifiers that impact gameplay, such as:
  - Presence of enemies
  - Loot availability
  - Room conditions (light, dark, wet, cold, etc.)

## Unique Approach

Instead of using a graphical engine, I’ve chosen to implement the game entirely in terminal windows, since I really like the concept, and it does add some challenge and a different gameplay experience. I don't know if this will work out well or not, but I will soon find out

The way I plan on doing that is by using `.bat` files to open multiple CMD windows, with each window handling a distinct game element, such as:

- **Character Status**
- **Inventory**
- **Room Details**
- **The game itself**
- **(experimental) ascii art of enemies**

## Current State

- **In Development**: The game is not functional yet, but I’m continuously publishing changes as I work on it.
- obs. You might notice that my code, specially the classes and OOP related stuff, could be a bit messy. Since this is my first OOP project I ever worked on, I am both making it and learning at the same time.
